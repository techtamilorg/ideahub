# IdeaHub Process

This document describes how project ideas move from submission through voting, discussion, approval, and implementation. Each step shows the state changes (labels) that track an idea’s progress.

---

## 1. Submission

1. **Issue Created → `idea`**  
   - A contributor opens a new issue with a short title and 2–3 sentences explaining the idea.  
   - The issue is automatically labeled `idea`. Explanations can be simple
   - The contributor is required to answer atleast following minimum inrelated to an idea "What the idea is ?" , "Why the idea is important ?"

---

## 2. Voting & Feedback

1. **`idea` → Community Reactions**  
   - Anyone clicks 👍 on the issue to show support.  
   - Comments can be added to ask questions or suggest improvements.

---

## 3. Triage & Discussion

1. **Monthly  Review of `idea` Issues**  
   - Maintainers scan all issues labeled `idea`.  
   - Ideas with few or no 👍 reactions remain in `idea`.  
   - Ideas with multiple 👍 or positive comments move forward.

2. **If an idea seems valuable → `under-discussion`**  
   - The label changes from `idea` → `under-discussion`.  
   - Maintainers or community members can debate feasibility, scope, and priorities.

3. **If an idea has major concerns or duplicates → `rejected`**  
   - The label changes from `idea` → `rejected`.  
   - A short comment explains the reason (e.g., “Duplicate of #5” or “Out of scope”).

---

## 4. Approval

1. **When consensus is reached → `approved`**  
   - If discussion shows clear value and no blocking issues, change the label from `under-discussion` → `approved`.  
   - Optionally, add a comment summarizing why it was approved.

2. **Assign & Schedule**  
   - The issue is assigned to a owner of  the idea and project is kicked off
